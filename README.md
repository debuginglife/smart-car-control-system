# ðŸš— Smart Car Control System  

A smart car project using **Arduino/ESP32, Python, and sensors** for IoT-based control.  
This project is designed as a beginner-friendly robotics + electronics project, aligned with my goal of pursuing **ECE (Electronics & Communication Engineering)**.

## âœ¨ Features
- Bluetooth / Wi-Fi based car control  
- Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensor  
- Python control program (PC GUI / Terminal)  
- Expandable to IoT (camera, GPS, remote monitoring)  

---

## ðŸ”§ Components Used
- Arduino Uno / ESP32  
- L298N Motor Driver  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Bluetooth Module (HC-05) or Wi-Fi (ESP32 inbuilt)  
- DC Motors + Car Chassis  
- Python 3 (for control program)

## âš¡ How to Run
### 1. Arduino/ESP32 Setup
- Open `/arduino_code/car_control.ino` in Arduino IDE  
- Upload the code to Arduino Uno / ESP32  
- Connect motor driver + sensors as per circuit diagram  

### 2. Python Control
- Go to `/python_control/`  
- Run `controller.py`  
- Connect to Arduino/ESP32 via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi  
- Use keys/buttons to control the car
